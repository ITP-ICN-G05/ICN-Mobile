# 🚫 Sampling Removal Summary

## ✅ **Sampling System Completely Removed**

The old sampling system that was running alongside the backend integration has been completely eliminated.

### 🔧 **Changes Made:**

1. **✅ Updated MapScreen.tsx**:
   - Removed `import icnDataService from '../../services/icnDataService'`
   - Added `import { useICNData } from '../../hooks/useICNData'`
   - Replaced old data loading logic with backend hook
   - Updated search logic to use backend search functions

2. **✅ Removed companiesSlice.ts**:
   - Deleted the entire file as it was using the old `icnDataService`
   - Removed from Redux store configuration
   - Cleaned up middleware configuration

3. **✅ Updated Redux Store**:
   - Removed `companiesReducer` from store configuration
   - Removed `companies/setCompanies` from ignored actions
   - Store now only contains necessary reducers

### 🎯 **Result:**

- ❌ **No more sampling**: The old `icnDataService` sampling system is completely disabled
- ✅ **Pure backend data**: All components now use the `useICNData` hook with backend API
- ✅ **Consistent data**: All screens (CompaniesScreen, MapScreen) use the same backend data source
- ✅ **No duplicate loading**: Only one data source is active

### 📊 **Before vs After:**

**Before:**
```
LOG  Loading ICN data (sampling: true)...
LOG  Loaded 507 ICN items
LOG  Valid ICN items: 368
LOG  Processed 2669 unique companies before sampling
LOG  Starting stratified sampling from 2669 companies to 300
LOG  Sampled 300 companies for geocoding
```

**After:**
```
LOG  🔄 Loading data from backend API...
LOG  📊 Backend returned organisations: 399
LOG  🏢 Converted companies: 399
LOG  ✅ Data loading completed successfully
```

### 🚀 **Benefits:**

1. **Performance**: No more unnecessary sampling and geocoding
2. **Data Consistency**: All components use the same backend data
3. **Real-time**: Direct connection to backend database
4. **Scalability**: Can handle full dataset without sampling limits
5. **Maintainability**: Single data source, easier to debug and maintain

The app now uses **100% backend data** with no sampling or local data processing! 🎉
